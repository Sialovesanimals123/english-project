            <p>Let It Go - A Twisted Tale is part of the Twisted Tale book series by Disney, where each story explores a different "what if" question about popular Disney movies. 
                In this version, the book asks: What if Elsa and Anna never knew each other? 
                It takes the story we all know from Frozen and completely changes it by imagining what their lives would be like if they had been separated for most of their lives. 
                The book was written by Jen Calonita and came out as part of a larger collection of Disney alternative stories. 
                These stories are meant to explore deeper ideas and allow fans to see their favorite characters in brand-new ways.

                The story has a lot of symbolism that connects to real life. For example, Elsa’s powers represent emotions that we sometimes hide, like fear or sadness. 
                Just like Elsa hides her magic because she’s afraid it will hurt someone, people often hide their feelings when they’re scared of being judged. 
                As Elsa learns to accept herself, it shows the message that it’s okay to be different and that being true to who you are is really powerful.
                Another important symbol is the memory of Anna that Elsa starts to have. 
                These memories show how strong the bond between siblings or family can be, even if time or distance separates them. 
                The kingdom of Arendelle also represents peace and balance. When the sisters are apart, the kingdom suffers.
                But when they come back together, things start to heal, which shows how important love, teamwork, and family can be.
                Overall, the book teaches us that love, truth, and courage can help fix even the biggest problems and that we don’t need magic to be heroes.
