                    In Let It Go, Elsa is a really interesting and powerful character. 
                    She is an Ice Queen, and she has magical ice powers, but in this version of the story, she grew up without Anna by her side. 
                    That makes her more serious and lonely at the beginning of the book. 
                    She is always trying to do what is best for her kingdom, even if that means hiding how she really feels.
                <br> As the story goes on, you get to see a different side of Elsa. 
                    She starts remembering things from her past, like a little girl who seems familiar but she doesn’t realize right away that it’s Anna, her sister.
                    What I liked most about Elsa is how brave she is. 
                    She doesn't give up, even when everything seems to be going wrong. 
                    She is smart, powerful, and cares a lot about her people. 
                    And when she finally reunites with Anna, you can really see how much she is changed and how important family is to her.

                In this book, Anna is super brave, kind, and full of energy, just like in the movie, but this time her story is a bit different. 
                She grew up without knowing she had a sister, so she is always felt like something was missing. 
                Even though she doesn’t have any magical powers like Elsa, she is really strong in her own way because of her big heart and determination.
                <br>One thing I really liked about Anna is how she never gives up. 
                When she finds out she might have a sister, she doesn’t stop until she figures out the truth. 
                She is really curious and always wants to help others, even if it means putting herself in danger.
                Anna is also really funny and always tries to stay positive, even when things get scary. 
                She believes in love, family, and doing the right thing. 
                Anna is the kind of character who might not have powers, but she is still a hero because of her courage and kindness.
