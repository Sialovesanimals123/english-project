                <p class="rtext"> 
                    I totally loved Let It Go from the Twisted Tale series! Right from the first chapter, the story is super action packed and filled with surprises. 
                    One part I could not stop thinking about was when Elsa suddenly remembered a little girl from her past and it turned out to be her sister, Anna!

                    What made the book extra cool is that we get to see everything from both Elsa’s point of view and Anna’s. 
                    I also really liked the cliffhangers at the end of each chapter as they are like little tiny movies playing in your head and you just have to read on to find out what happens next!

                    The author’s writing style is really unique, too. 
                    There are words that I have never seen before, but they make the scenes feel magical and intense. 
                    As per me, you should definitely check this out for your fun reading time. I would recommend it for anyone age 12 and above.

                <h4 class="Summaryheading">Summary of the Book</h4>
                <p class="Summarytext">
                    Let It Go is a "what if" story that shows what would happen if Elsa and Anna never met. 
                    The book takes you through a bunch of exciting events that happen befor and after the sisters finally reunite after being apart for several years. 
                    But just when things start getting better, their kingdom is in danger, and they have to work together to face some really big challenges.
